\title{Gene expression data downsampled from GSE19380}
\format{A list with three matrices: mixture profiles (X), mixing proportions
(A) and pure profiles (S).}
\usage{
data(ratMix3)
}
\description{
Rat brain, liver and lung biospecimens derived from one animal at the cRNA
homogenate level in different proportions. 3 technical replicates each.
We downsample the original data to 10000 probes/probesets and 7 mixtures.
Proportions used in experiments and pure expression profiles are also
included.
