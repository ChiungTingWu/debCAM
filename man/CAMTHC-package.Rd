\title{CAMTHC: A package for Tissue Heterogeneity Characterization.}
\description{
The core function in this package is \code{\link{CAM}} which achieves fully
unsupervised deconvolution on mixture expression profiles.
Each step in \code{\link{CAM}} can also be performed seperately by
\code{\link{CAMPrep}}, \code{\link{CAMMGCluster}}
and \code{\link{CAMASest}} in a more flexiable workflow.
\code{\link{MGstatistic}} can help extract a complete marker list from CAM
results. \code{\link{MDL}} can help decide the underlying subpopulation
number. With other functions, e.g. \code{\link{AfromMarkers}} and
\code{\link{MGstatistic}}, this package can also perform supervised
deconlution based on prior knowledge of molecular markers,
subpopulation-specific expression matrix (S) or proportion matrix (A).
Semi-suprvised deconvolution can be achieved by combining molecular markers
from CAM and from prior knowledge to analyze mixture expressions.
