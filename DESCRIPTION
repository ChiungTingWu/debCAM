Description: An R package for tissue heterogeneity characterization by convex 
    analysis of mixtures (CAM). It provides basic functions to perform 
    unsupervised deconvolution on mixture expression profiles by CAM and some 
    auxiliary functions to help understand the subpopulation-specific results. 
    It also implements functions to perform supervised deconlution based on 
    prior knowledge of molecular markers, S matrix or A matrix. Combining 
    molecular markers from CAM and from prior knowledge can achieve 
    semi-suprvised deconvolution of mixtures.
